Getting Started:
This application is used for manipulating and training Artificial Intelligence models. Applications like these are useful because
of the ability to dynamically save a model to storage from memory if it works and disregard it if the model doesn't. There is also the
ability of this program to load multiple models and training sets at once to maximize the training experience.

On surface glance, this may seem trivial, but actually programming models over and over again is a tedious task and having a
command line program to do these functions allows you to generate and develop A.I. faster.

It may be useful to input the /c command to look at some of the commands.
:Training your first A.I.:
To begin training your first Artificial Intelligence, insert the command 'generate'.
:Training Data Formatting:
Training data should look like the following inside your loaded text file; [[[inputs],[correct outputs]],[[inputs],[correct outputs]], etc...]
:Why am I getting errors?:
Errors may come from a variety of factors in the program, however, mainly from data errors.

Tip 1 - There should be no values <1 in the data set unless they are statistically significant.
Tip 2 - Small learning rates. Traditionally, .01 or .001 are very good to start with to prevent NaN values.
Tip 3 - Error rates. I use .05 in testing as a threshold to stop calculations.
Tip 4 - Ensure your model is big enough to encompass a meaningful relationship in the training data.

:To-Do:
Implement solutions for exploding weights.
    - Gradient Clipping -
    - Weight Clipping -
    - Bias Differentiation -
    - Implement the Reset command in my main text line program -
    - Alphabetically order the commands when the prompt 'guide' is given
