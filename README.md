# Artificial-Intelligence
This project was a personal challenge that has now taken over two hundred hours of learning every aspect of modern Artificial Intelligence from scratch, and then implementing this knowledge in code. This is done WITHOUT the use of any A.I. modules such as Tensorflow or Pytorch. 

This project's end goal is generally to have a final software that can learn. The furthest client side development will only accomadte for commands entered into a python console or command line (if compiled). 

This is in the middle phase of development, with the backend work for backpropagation being the current phase I am working through. 

## Functions 
This folder is a module in itself for the client end program to use for actual A.I. development and manipulation inside of an application.
