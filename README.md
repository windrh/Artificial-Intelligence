## Artificial-Intelligence
This project was a personal challenge that has now taken over two hundred hours of learning every aspect of modern Artificial Intelligence from scratch, and then implementing this knowledge in code. This is done WITHOUT the use of any A.I. modules such as Tensorflow or Pytorch. 
# Functions 
This folder is a module in itself for the client end program to use for actual A.I. development and manipulation inside of an application.
